    Three Horses Drink Water at the Riverbank

    One white, one red, one black<br/>
    Three horses are drinking at the riverbank<br/>
    They drink at their own pace, some up</br/>
    Some down<br/>
    Sometimes their heads reach the river<br/>
    At the same time <br/>
    As if a river were flowing<br/>
    Out of their mouths <br/>
    As their minds flow from the river source<br/>
    Still innocent, clear, undisturbed<br/>
    The sun is setting slowly<br/>
    A man watches, without blinking<br/>
    How a river disappears into the night<br/>
    Held in the mouths of three horses
