                    Dear Miss Gonda,
                    <br><br>
                    I am not a regular movie fan, but I have never missed a picture of yours. There is something about you which I can’t give a name to, something I had and lost, but I feel as if you’re keeping it for me, for all of us. I had it long ago, when I was very young. You know how it is: when you’re very young. You know how it is: when you’re very young, there’s something ahead of you, so big that you’re afraid of it, but you wait for it and you’re so happy waiting. Then the years pass and it never comes. And then you find, one day, that you’re not waiting any longer. It seems foolish, because you didn’t even know what it was you were waiting for. I look at myself and I don’t know. But when I look at you—I do.
                    
                    And if ever, by some miracle, you were to enter my life, I’d drop everything, and follow you, and gladly lay down my life for you, because, you see, I’m still a human being.
                    <br><br>
                    Very truly yours,<br>
                    George S. Perkins<br>
                    ... S. Hoover Street Los Angeles, California

                    When the letter ends, all lights go out, and when they come on again, the screen has disappeared and the stage reveals the living room of <span class="small-caps">GEORGE S. PERKINS</span>. It is a room such as thousands of other rooms in thousands of other homes whose owners have a respectable little income and a respectable little character. Center back, a wide glass door opening on the street. Door into the rest of the house in wall Left.

                    When the curtain rises, it is evening. The street outside is dark. <span class="small-caps">MRS. PERKINS</span> stands in the middle of the room, tense, erect, indignant, watching with smoldering emotion the entrance door where <span class="small-caps">GEORGE S. PERKINS</span>  seen outside turning the key in the lock. <span class="small-caps">MRS. PERKINS</span>  like a dried-out bird of prey that has never been young. <span class="small-caps">GEORGE S. PERKINS</span> is short, blond, heavy, helpless, and over forty. He is whistling a gay tune as he enters. He is in a very cheerful mood.

                    MRS. PERKINS: <i>[Without moving, ominously]</i> You’re late.

                    PERKINS: <i>[Cheerfully]</i> Well, dovey, I have a good excuse for being late.

                    MRS. PERKINS: <i>[Speaking very fast]</i> I have no doubt about that. But listen to me, George Perkins, you’ll have to do something about Junior. That boy of yours got a D again in arithmetic. If a father don’t take the proper interest in his children, what can you expect from a boy who...

                    PERKINS: Aw, honeybunch, we’ll excuse the kid for once—just to celebrate.

                    MRS. PERKINS: Celebrate what?
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: How would you like to be Mrs. Assistant Manager of the Daffodil Canning Company?

                    MRS. PERKINS: I would like it very much. Not that I have any hopes of ever being.

                    PERKINS: Well, dovey, you are. As of today.
