                    <p><span class="ideal"><i>Ideal</i></span> was written in 1934, at a time when Ayn Rand had cause to be unhappy with the world. <i>We the Living</i> was being rejected by a succession of publishers for being “too intellectual” and too opposed to Soviet Russia (this was the time of America's Red Decade); <i>Night of January 16th</i> had not yet found a producer; and Miss Rand's meager savings were running out. The story was written originally as a novelette and then, probably within a year or two, was extensively revised and turned into a stage play. It has never been produced.</p>

                    <p>After the political themes of her first professional work, Ayn Rand now returns to the subject matter of her early stories: the role of values in men's lives. The focus in this case, as in “Her Second Career,” is negative, but this time the treatment is not jovial; dominantly, it is sober and heartfelt. The issue now is men's lack of integrity, their failure to act according to the <span class="ideal">ideals</span> they espouse. The theme is the evil of divorcing <span class="ideal">ideals</span> from life...</p>

                    <p><i>Late afternoon. Office of <span class="small-caps">ANTHONY FARROW</span> in the Farrow Film Studios.

                    <p class="no-indent">Dear Miss Gonda,</p>

                    <p>I am not a regular movie fan, but I have never missed a picture of yours. There is something about you which I can't give a name to, something I had and lost, but I feel as if you're keeping it for me, for all of us. I had it long ago, when I was very young. You know how it is: when you're very young. You know how it is: when you're very young, there's something ahead of you, so big that you're afraid of it, but you wait for it and you're so happy waiting. Then the years pass and it never comes. And then you find, one day, that you're not waiting any longer. It seems foolish, because you didn't even know what it was you were waiting for. I look at myself and I don't know. But when I look at you—I do.</p>
                    
                    <p>And if ever, by some miracle, you were to enter my life, I'd drop everything, and follow you, and gladly lay down my life for you, because, you see, I'm still a human being.</p>

                    <p>Very truly yours,</p>
