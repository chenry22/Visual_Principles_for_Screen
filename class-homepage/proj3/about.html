        This is a project for Visual Principles for the Screen. The goal of this project was to translate an existing piece of text into a website. I chose the novel/play "Ideal" by Ayn Rand, which I read over the summer of 2025 and was really impacted by. To see more coding projects of mine you can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/chenry22">visit my Github</a>, to view more design oriented stuff I actually don't really have anything set up sorry.
