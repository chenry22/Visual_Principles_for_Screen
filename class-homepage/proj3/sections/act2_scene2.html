                    <p>
                        I have had everything men ask of life. I have seen it all, and I feel as if I were leaving a third-rate show on a disreputable side street. If I do not bother to die, it is only because my life has all the emptiness of the grave and my death would have no change to offer me. It may happen, any day now, and nobody—not even the one writing these lines—will know the difference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But before it happens, I want to raise what is left of my soul in a last salute to you, you who are that which the world should have been.

It is a large, luxurious room, modern, exquisitely simple. Wide entrance door in center wall Left. Smaller door to bedroom in wall Right, upstage. Large window in wall Left, showing the dark view of a park far below. Downstage Right a fireplace. One single lamp burning.

She walks in first and falls, exhausted, on a sofa downstage, stretching out her legs with a gesture of charming lassitude.<span class="small-caps">DIETRICH VON ESTERHAZY</span> follows her silently. She makes a little gesture, expecting him to take her wrap. But he does not approach her or look at her, and she shrugs, throwing her wrap back, letting it slide halfway down her bare arms.

                    <span class='kay-gonda'>KAY GONDA</span>: What?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='dialogue'>ESTERHAZY</span>: Your coming here to hide.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='kay-gonda'>KAY GONDA</span>: How did you know that?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='dialogue'>ESTERHAZY</span>: Because it could have occurred only to you. Because you’re the only one capable of the exquisite sensitiveness to recognize the only sincere letter I’ve ever written in my life.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='kay-gonda'>KAY GONDA</span>: <i>[Looking at him]</i> Was it?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='dialogue'>ESTERHAZY</span>: <i>[Studying her openly, speaking casually, matter-of-factly]</i> You look taller than you do on the screen—and less real. Your hair is blonder than I thought. Your voice about a tone higher. It is a pity that the camera does not photograph the shade of your lipstick. <i>[In a different voice, warm and natural]</i> And now that I’ve done my duty as a fan reacting, sit down and let’s forget the unusual circumstances.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='kay-gonda'>KAY GONDA</span>: Do you really want me to stay here?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='dialogue'>ESTERHAZY</span>: <i>[Looking at the room]</i> The place is not too uncomfortable. There’s a slight draft from the window at times, and the people upstairs become noisy occasionally, but not often. <i>[Looking at her]</i> No, I won’t tell you how glad I am to see you here. I never speak of the things that mean much to me. The occasions have been too rare. I’ve lost the habit.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='kay-gonda'>KAY GONDA</span>: <i>[Sitting down]</i> Thank you.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='dialogue'>ESTERHAZY</span>: For what?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='kay-gonda'>KAY GONDA</span>: For what you didn’t say.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='dialogue'>ESTERHAZY</span>: Do you know that it is really I who must thank you? Not only for coming, but for coming tonight of all nights.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='kay-gonda'>KAY GONDA</span>: Why?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='dialogue'>ESTERHAZY</span>: Perhaps you have taken a life in order to save another. <i>[Pause]</i> A long time ago—no, isn’t that strange?—it was only a few minutes ago—I was ready to kill myself. Don’t look at me like that. It isn’t frightening. But what did become frightening was that feeling of utter indifference, even to death, even to my own indifference. And then you came. . . . I think I could hate you for coming.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='kay-gonda'>KAY GONDA</span>: I think you will.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class='dialogue'>ESTERHAZY</span>: <i>[With sudden fire, the first, unexpected emotion]</i> I don’t want to be proud of myself again. I had given it up. Yet now I am. Just because I see you here. Just because a thing has happened which is like nothing I thought possible on earth.

His arms were spread out and his body bent backward, and I could see him as an arc against the sky. He stood still and tense, like a string trembling to a note of ecstasy no man had ever heard. . . . I have never known who he was. I knew only that this was what life should be. . . . <i>[Her voice trails off]</i>

                    <br><br>
                    I’ve tried to renounce it. I thought I must close my eyes and bear anything and learn to live like the others. To make me as they were. To make me forget. I bore it. All of it. But I can’t forget the man on the rock. I can’t!
                    <br><br>
