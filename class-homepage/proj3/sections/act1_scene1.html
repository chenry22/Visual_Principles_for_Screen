                    <p class="no-indent">Dear Miss Gonda,</p>
                    <p>
                        I am not a regular movie fan, but I have never missed a picture of yours. There is something about you which I can't give a name to, something I had and lost, but I feel as if you're keeping it for me, for all of us. I had it long ago, when I was very young. You know how it is: when you're very young. You know how it is: when you're very young, there's something ahead of you, so big that you're afraid of it, but you wait for it and you're so happy waiting. Then the years pass and it never comes. And then you find, one day, that you're not waiting any longer. It seems foolish, because you didn't even know what it was you were waiting for. I look at myself and I don't know. But when I look at you—I do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And if ever, by some miracle, you were to enter my life, I'd drop everything, and follow you, and gladly lay down my life for you, because, you see, I'm still a human being.
                    </p>
                    <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                    MRS. PERKINS: What are you talking about? What better use can you find for your extra money than to take care of a baby?
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: That's just it. Take care of it. The hospital and the doctors. The strained vegetables—at two bits a can. The school and the measles. All over again. And nothing else.
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. PERKINS: So that's how you feel about your duties! There's nothing holier than to raise a family. There's no better blessing. Haven't I spent my life making a home for you? Don't you have everything every decent man struggles for? What else do you want?
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: Rosie, it's not that I don't like what I've got. I like it fine. Only. . . Well, it's like this bathrobe of mine. I'm glad I have it, it's warm and comfortable, and I like it, just the same as I like the rest of it. Just like that. And no more. There should be more.
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. PERKINS: Well, I like that! The swell bathrobe I picked out for your birthday! Well, if you didn't like it, why didn't you exchange it?
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: Oh, Rosie, it's not that! It's only that a man can't live his whole life for a bathrobe. Or for things that he feels the same way about. Things that do nothing to him—inside, I mean. 
                    <br><br>
                    There should be something that he's afraid of —afraid and happy. Like going to church—only not in a church. Something he can look up to. Something—high, Rosie. . . that's it, high.
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. PERKINS: Well, if it's culture you want, didn't I subscribe to the Book-of-the- Month Club?
