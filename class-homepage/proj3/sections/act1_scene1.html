                <div class="letter">
                    <p class="no-indent">Dear Miss Gonda,</p>
                    <p>
                        I am not a regular movie fan, but I have never missed a picture of yours. There is something about you which I can't give a name to, something I had and lost, but I feel as if you're keeping it for me, for all of us. I had it long ago, when I was very young. You know how it is: when you're very young. You know how it is: when you're very young, there's something ahead of you, so big that you're afraid of it, but you wait for it and you're so happy waiting. Then the years pass and it never comes. And then you find, one day, that you're not waiting any longer. It seems foolish, because you didn't even know what it was you were waiting for. I look at myself and I don't know. But when I look at you—I do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And if ever, by some miracle, you were to enter my life, I'd drop everything, and follow you, and gladly lay down my life for you, because, you see, I'm still a human being.
                    </p>
                    <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                    MRS. SHLY: Where did you pick that up? Decent people don't even know about such things! You hear about it maybe with gangsters and actresses. But in a respectable married home!
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. PERKINS: What's happened to you today?
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: It's not today, Rosie. It's for a long, long time back. . . . But I'm set with the firm now. I can take good care of you and the children. But the rest— Rosie, I can't throw it away for good.
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. PERKINS: What are you talking about? What better use can you find for your extra money than to take care of a baby?
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: That's just it. Take care of it. The hospital and the doctors. The strained vegetables—at two bits a can. The school and the measles. All over again. And nothing else.
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. PERKINS: So that's how you feel about your duties! There's nothing holier than to raise a family. There's no better blessing. Haven't I spent my life making a home for you? Don't you have everything every decent man struggles for? What else do you want?
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: Rosie, it's not that I don't like what I've got. I like it fine. Only. . . Well, it's like this bathrobe of mine. I'm glad I have it, it's warm and comfortable, and I like it, just the same as I like the rest of it. Just like that. And no more. There should be more.
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. PERKINS: Well, I like that! The swell bathrobe I picked out for your birthday! Well, if you didn't like it, why didn't you exchange it?
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: Oh, Rosie, it's not that! It's only that a man can't live his whole life for a bathrobe. Or for things that he feels the same way about. Things that do nothing to him—inside, I mean. 
                    <br><br>
                    There should be something that he's afraid of —afraid and happy. Like going to church—only not in a church. Something he can look up to. Something—high, Rosie. . . that's it, high.
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. PERKINS: Well, if it's culture you want, didn't I subscribe to the Book-of-the-Month Club?

Now, don't let me hear another word out of that filthy mouth of yours! Do you want to kill your wife? Take the Chinese, for instance. They go in for abortions, that's why all the Chinks have rickets.

                    MRS. SHLY: So? So that's it? So I'm making trouble? So I'm a burden to you, am I? Well, I'm glad you came out with it, Mr. Perkins!

                    PERKINS: Did you kill Granton Sayers? [She looks at him, smiles slowly, shrugs] I was only wondering why you could have done it.

                    KAY GONDA: You said you were not happy.
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: I. . . I didn’t mean to complain, Miss Gonda, only. . . I guess I’ve missed something along the way. I don’t know what it is, but I know I’ve missed it. Only I don’t know why.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: Perhaps it is because you wanted to miss it.
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: No. [His voice is suddenly firm] No. [He rises and stands looking straight at her] You see, I’m not unhappy at all. In fact, I’m a very happy man —as happiness goes. Only there’s something in me that knows of a life I’ve never lived, the kind of life no one has ever lived, but should.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: You know it? Why don’t you live it?
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: Who does? Who can? Who ever gets a chance at the. . . the very best possible to him? We all bargain. We take the second best. That’s all there is to be had. But the. . . the God in us, it knows the other. . . the very best. . . which never comes.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: And. . . if it came?
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: We’d grab it—because there is a God in us.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: And. . . the God in you, you really want it?
                    <br><br>
                    PERKINS: [Fiercely] Look, I know this: let them come, the cops, let them come now and try to get you. Let them tear this house down. I built it—took me fifteen years to pay for it. Let them tear it down, before I let them take you. Let them come, whoever it is that’s after you. . .
