                    <p class="no-indent">Dear Miss Gonda,</p>
                    <p>
                        This letter is addressed to you, but I am writing it to myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am writing and thinking that I am speaking to a woman who is the only justification for the existence of this earth, and who has the courage to want to be. A woman who does not assume a glory of greatness for a few hours, then return to the children-dinner-friends- football-and-God reality. A woman who seeks that glory in her every minute and her every step. A woman in whom life is not a curse, nor a bargain, but a hymn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want nothing except to know that such a woman exists. So I have written this, even though you may not bother to read it, or reading it, may not understand. I do not know what you are. I am writing to what you could have been.
                    </p>
                    <p>Johhnie Dawes</p>
                    <p>... Main Street</p>

                        Lights go out, screen disappears, and stage reveals garret of <span class="small-caps">JOHNNIE DAWES</span>. It is a squalid, miserable room with a low, slanting ceiling, with dark walls showing beams under cracked plaster. The room is so bare that it gives the impression of being uninhabited, a strange, intangible impression of unreality. A narrow iron cot, at wall Right; a broken table, a few boxes for chairs. A narrow door opens diagonally in the Left upstage corner. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The entire wall Center is a long window checkered into small panes. It opens high over the skyline of Los Angeles. Behind the black shadows of skyscrapers, there is a first hint of pink in the dark sky. When the curtain rises, the stage is empty, dark. One barely distinguishes the room and sees only the faintly luminous panorama of the window. It dominates the stage, so that one forgets the room, and it seems as if the setting is only the city and the sky. (Throughout the scene, the sky lightens slowly, the pink band of dawn grows, rising.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steps are heard coming up the stairs. A quivering light shows in the cracks of the door. The door opens to admit <span class="small-caps kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>. Behind her, <span class="small-caps">MRS. MONAGHAN</span>, an old landlady, shuffles in, with a lighted candle in hand. She puts the candle down on the table, and stands panting as after a long climb, studying <span class="small-caps kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span> with a suspicious curiosity.

                    MRS. MONAGHAN: Here ye are. This is it.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: [Looking slowly over the room] Thank you.
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. MONAGHAN: And ye’re a relative of him, ye are?
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: No.
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. MONAGHAN: [Maliciously] Sure, and I was thinking that.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: I have never seen him before.
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. MONAGHAN: Well, I’m after tellin’ ye he’s no good, that’s what he is, no good. It’s a born bum he is. No rent never. He can’t keep a job more’n two weeks.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: When will he be back?
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. MONAGHAN: Any minute at all—or never, for all I know. He runs around all night, the good Lord only knows where. Just walks the streets like the bum he is, just walks. Comes back drunk like, only he’s not drunk, ’cause I know he don’t drink.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: I will wait for him.
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. MONAGHAN: Suit yerself. [Looks at her shrewdly] Maybe ye got a job for him?
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: No. I have no job for him.
                    <br><br>
                    MRS. MONAGHAN: He’s got himself kicked out again, three days ago it was. He had a swell job bellhoppin’. Did it last? It did not. Same as the soda counter. Same as the waitin’ at Hamburger Looey’s. He’s no good, I’m tellin’ ye. I know him. Better’n ye do.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: I do not know him at all.

                    MRS. MONAGHAN: And I can’t say I blame his bosses, either. He’s a strange one. Never a laugh, never a joke out of him. [Confidentially] Ye know what Hamburger Looey said to me? He said, “Stuck up little snot,” said Hamburger Looey, “makes a regular guy feel creepy.”
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: So Hamburger Looey said that?

                    MRS. MONAGHAN: Faith and he did. [Confidentially] And d’ye know? He’s been to college, that boy. Ye’d never believe it from the kind of jobs he can’t keep, but he has. What he learned there the good Lord only knows. It’s no good it done him. And . . . [Stops, listening. Steps are heard rising up the stairs] That’s him now! Nobody else’d be shameless enough to come home at this hour of the night. [At the door] Ye think it over. Maybe ye could do somethin’ for him. [Exits]

Where can I hear them, so that I might go on? I want to see real, living, and in the hours of my own days, that glory I create as an illusion! I want it real! I want to know that there is someone, somewhere, who wants it, too! Or else what is the use of seeing it, and working, and burning oneself for an impossible vision? A spirit, too, needs fuel. It can run dry.

These few give life its meaning. The rest—well, the rest are what you see they are. You have a duty. To live. Just to remain on earth. To let them know you do and can exist. To fight, even a fight without hope. We can’t give up the earth to all those others.

                    KAY GONDA: There was a great man once who said: “I love those that know not how to live today.”

                    JOHNNIE: [Quietly] I think I am a person who should never have been born. This is not a complaint. I am not afraid and I am not sorry. But I have often wanted to die. I have no desire to change the world—nor to take any part in it, as it is. I’ve never had the weapons which you have. I’ve never even found the desire to find weapons. I’d like to go, calmly and willingly.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: I don’t want to hear you say that.

                    JOHNNIE: There has always been something holding me here. Something that had to come to me before I went. I want to know one living moment of that which is mine, not theirs. Not their dismal little pleasures. One moment of ecstasy, utter and absolute, a moment that must not be survived. . . . They’ve never given me a life. I’ve always hoped I would choose my death.
                    <br><br>
