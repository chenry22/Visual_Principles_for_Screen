                        Entrance hall in the residence of <span class="small-caps kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>. It is high, bare, modern in its austere simplicity. There is no furniture, no ornaments of any kind. The upper part of the hall is a long raised platform, dividing the room horizontally, and three broad continuous steps lead down from it to the foreground. Tall, square columns rise at the upper edge of the steps. Door into the rest of the house downstage in wall Left. The entire back wall is of wide glass panes, with an entrance door in the center. Beyond the house, there is a narrow path among jagged rocks, a thin strip of the high coast with a broad view of the ocean beyond and of a flaming sunset sky. The hall is dim. There is no light, save the glow of the sunset.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At curtain rise, <span class="small-caps">MICK WATTS</span> is sitting on the top step, leaning down toward a dignified <span class="small-caps">BUTLER</span> who sits on the floor below, stiff, upright, and uncomfortable holding a tray with a full highball glass on it. <span class="small-caps">MICK WATTS</span>’ shirt collar is torn open, his tie hanging loose, his hair disheveled. He is clutching a newspaper ferociously. He is sober.

                    MICK WATTS: [Continuing a discourse that has obviously been going on for some time, speaking in an even, expressionless monotone, his manner earnest, confidential] . . . and so the king called them all before his throne and he said: “I’m weary and sick of it. I am tired of my kingdom where not a single man is worth ruling. I am tired of my lusterless crown, for it does not reflect a single flame of glory anywhere in my land.” . . . You see, he was a very foolish king. Some scream it, like he did, and squash their damn brains out against a wall. Others stagger on, like a dog chasing a shadow, knowing damn well that there is no shadow to chase, but still going on, their hearts empty and their paws bleeding. . . . 
                    <br><br>
                    So the king said to them on his deathbed—oh, this was another time; he was on his deathbed this time—he said: “It is the end, but I am still hoping. There is no end. Ever shall I go on hoping . . . ever . . . ever.” [Looks suddenly at the BUTLER, as if noticing him for the first time, and asks in an entirely different voice, pointing at him:] What the hell are you doing here?
                    <br><br>
                    BUTLER: [Rising] May I observe, sir, that you have been speaking for an hour and a quarter?
                    <br><br>
                    MICK WATTS: Have I?
                    <br><br>
                    BUTLER: You have, sir. So, if I may be forgiven, I took the liberty of sitting down. 
                    <br><br>
                    MICK WATTS: [Surprised] Fancy, you were here all the time!
                    <br><br>
                    BUTLER: Yes, sir.
                    <br><br>
                    MICK WATTS: Well, what did you want here in the first place?
                    <br><br>
                    BUTLER: [Extending the tray] Your whiskey, sir.
                    <br><br>
                    MICK WATTS: Oh! [Reaches for the glass, but stops, jerks the crumpled newspaper at the BUTLER, asks:] Have you read this?

                    MISS SAYERS: But when you heard those preposterous rumors accusing you of his murder, you should have come to me at once! When I asked you, at the house that night, not to disclose to anyone the manner of my brother’s death, I had no way of knowing what suspicions would arise. I tried my best to get in touch with you. Please believe me that I did not start those rumors.

                    KAY GONDA: Well, Mick, seventy-five million, six hundred thousand people hate me. They hate me in their hearts for the things they see in me, the things they have betrayed. I mean nothing to them, except a reproach. . . . 
                    <br><br>
                    But there are three hundred and twelve others—perhaps only the twelve. There are a few who want the highest possible and will take nothing less and will not live on any other terms. . . . It is with them that I am signing a contract tomorrow. We can’t give up the earth to all those others.

                    MICK WATTS: [Holding out the newspaper] And what about this?
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: I’ve answered you.
                    <br><br>
                    MICK WATTS: But you are a murderess, Kay Gonda! You killed that boy!
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: No, Mick, not I alone.
                    <br><br>
                    MICK WATTS: But the poor fool thought that he had to save your life!
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: He has.
                    <br><br>
                    MICK WATTS: What?!
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: He wanted to die that I may live. He did just that.
                    <br><br>
                    MICK WATTS: But don’t you realize what you’ve done?
