                        Entrance hall in the residence of <span class="small-caps kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>. It is high, bare, modern in its austere simplicity. There is no furniture, no ornaments of any kind. The upper part of the hall is a long raised platform, dividing the room horizontally, and three broad continuous steps lead down from it to the foreground. Tall, square columns rise at the upper edge of the steps. Door into the rest of the house downstage in wall Left. The entire back wall is of wide glass panes, with an entrance door in the center. Beyond the house, there is a narrow path among jagged rocks, a thin strip of the high coast with a broad view of the ocean beyond and of a flaming sunset sky. The hall is dim. There is no light, save the glow of the sunset.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At curtain rise, <span class="small-caps">MICK WATTS</span> is sitting on the top step, leaning down toward a dignified <span class="small-caps">BUTLER</span> who sits on the floor below, stiff, upright, and uncomfortable holding a tray with a full highball glass on it. <span class="small-caps">MICK WATTS</span>’ shirt collar is torn open, his tie hanging loose, his hair disheveled. He is clutching a newspaper ferociously. He is sober.

                    <span class="dialogue">MICK WATTS</span>: <i>[Continuing a discourse that has obviously been going on for some time, speaking in an even, expressionless monotone, his manner earnest, confidential]</i> . . . and so the king called them all before his throne and he said: “I’m weary and sick of it. I am tired of my kingdom where not a single man is worth ruling. I am tired of my lusterless crown, for it does not reflect a single flame of glory anywhere in my land.” . . . 
                    <br><br>
                    You see, he was a very foolish king. Some scream it, like he did, and squash their damn brains out against a wall. Others stagger on, like a dog chasing a shadow, knowing damn well that there is no shadow to chase, but still going on, their hearts empty and their paws bleeding. . . . 
                    <br><br>
                    So the king said to them on his deathbed—oh, this was another time; he was on his deathbed this time—he said: “It is the end, but I am still hoping. There is no end. Ever shall I go on hoping . . . ever . . . ever.” <i>[Looks suddenly at the BUTLER, as if noticing him for the first time, and asks in an entirely different voice, pointing at him:]</i> What the hell are you doing here?

                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: Would you mind going home, Mick? I am very tired.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">MICK WATTS</span>: I hope you’ve . . .
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: Telephone the studio on your way. Tell them that I will sign the contract tomorrow.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">MICK WATTS</span>: I hope you’ve had a good time! I hope you’ve enjoyed it! But I’m through!
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: I’ll see you at the studio tomorrow at nine.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">MICK WATTS</span>: I’m through! God, I wish I could quit!
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: You know that you will never quit, Mick.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">MICK WATTS</span>: That’s the hell of it! That you know it, too! Why do I serve you like a dog and will go on serving you like a dog for the rest of my days? Why can’t I resist any crazy whim of yours? Why did I have to go and spread rumors about a murder you never committed? Just because you wanted to find out something? Well, have you found it out?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: Yes.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">MICK WATTS</span>: What have you found out?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: How many people saw my last picture? Do you remember those figures?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">MICK WATTS</span>: Seventy-five million, six hundred thousand, three hundred and twelve.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: Well, Mick, seventy-five million, six hundred thousand people hate me. They hate me in their hearts for the things they see in me, the things they have betrayed. I mean nothing to them, except a reproach. . . . 
                    <br><br>
                    But there are three hundred and twelve others—perhaps only the twelve. There are a few who want the highest possible and will take nothing less and will not live on any other terms. . . . It is with them that I am signing a contract tomorrow. We can’t give up the earth to all those others.

                    <span class="dialogue">MICK WATTS</span>: <i>[Holding out the newspaper]</i> And what about this?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: I’ve answered you.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">MICK WATTS</span>: But you are a murderess, <span class="kay-gonda">Kay Gonda</span>! You killed that boy!
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: No, Mick, not I alone.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">MICK WATTS</span>: But the poor fool thought that he had to save your life!
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: He has.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">MICK WATTS</span>: What?!
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: He wanted to die that I may live. He did just that.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">MICK WATTS</span>: But don’t you realize what you’ve done?
