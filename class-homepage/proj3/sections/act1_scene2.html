                    <p class="no-indent">Dear Miss Gonda,</p>
                    <p>
                        The determinism of duty has conditioned me to pursue the relief of my fellow men's suffering. I see daily before me the wrecks and victims of an outrageous social system. But I gain courage for my cause when I look at you on the screen and realize of what greatness the human race is capable. Your art is a symbol of the hidden potentiality which I see in my derelict brothers. None of them chose to be what he is. None of us ever chooses the bleak, hopeless life he is forced to lead. But in our ability to recognize you and bow to you lies the hope of mankind.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        Lights go out, screen disappears, and stage reveals living room in the home of <span class="small-caps">CHUCK FINK</span>. It is a miserable room in a run-down furnished bungalow. Entrance door upstage in wall Right; large open window next to it, downstage; door to bedroom in wall Center. Late evening. Although there are electric fixtures in the room, it is lighted by a single kerosene lamp smoking in a corner. The tenants are moving out; two battered trunks and a number of grocery cartons stand in the middle of the room; closets and chests gape open, half emptied; clothes, books, dishes, every conceivable piece of household junk are piled indiscriminately into great heaps on the floor.

                        At curtain rise, <span class="small-caps">CHUCK FINK</span> is leaning anxiously out of the window; he is a young man of about thirty, slight, anemic, with a rich mane of dark hair, a cadaverous face, and a neat little mustache. He is watching the people seen hurrying past the window in great agitation; there is a dim confusion of voices outside. He sees someone outside and calls:

[She finds one and lights it; she smokes nervously, continuously throughout the scene] Trial next week. They don't think the scab will recover.

I've had an article printed in <i>The Nation</i>! Yes, in <i>The Nation</i>! If I didn't bury myself with you in this mudhole of a . . .

                    FANNY: Oh, Lord, Chuck, what's the use? Look at the others. Look at Miranda Lumkin. A column in the <i>Courier</i> and a villa at Palm Springs! And she couldn't hold a candle to me in college! Everybody always said I was an advanced thinker. [Points at the room] <i>This</i> is what one gets for being an advanced thinker.

                    FINK: [Quite recovering himself] But of course! My letter. I knew you'd notice it among the thousands. Pretty good, wasn't it?

                    FANNY: Sure they would. People pay more than that for ordinary kidnappers.
                    <br><br>
                    FINK: Oh, shut up! [Silence. He continues to undress]
                    <br><br>
                    FANNY: It's jail for me, Chuck. Months, maybe years in jail.
                    <br><br>
                    FINK: Yeah . . .
                    <br><br>
                    FANNY: And for the others, too. Bud, and Pinky, and Mary, and the rest. Your friends. Your comrades. [He stops his undressing] You need them. The cause needs them. Twelve of our vanguard.
                    <br><br>
                    FINK: Yes . . .
                    <br><br>
                    FANNY: With five thousand, we'd get the best lawyer from New York. He'd beat the case. . . . And we wouldn't have to move out of here. We wouldn't have to worry. You could continue your great work. . . . [He does not answer] Think of all the poor and helpless who need you. . . . [He does not answer] Think of twelve human beings you're sending to jail . . . twelve to one, Chuck. . . . [He does not answer] Think of your duty to millions of your brothers. Millions to one. [Silence]

                    FINK: Fanny . . .
                    <br><br>
                    FANNY: Yes?
                    <br><br>
                    FINK: How would we go about it?
                    <br><br>
                    FANNY: Easy. We get out while she's asleep. We run to the police station. Come back with the cops. Easy.
                    <br><br>
                    FINK: What if she hears?
                    <br><br>
                    FANNY: She won't hear. But we got to hurry. [She moves to the door. He stops her]
                    <br><br>
                    FINK: [In a whisper] She'll hear the door opening.  [Points to the open window] This way . . .
