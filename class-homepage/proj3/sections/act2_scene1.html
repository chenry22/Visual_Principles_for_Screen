                        Some may call this letter a sacrilege. But as I write it, I do not feel like a sinner. For when I look at you on the screen, it seems to me that we are working for the same cause, you and I. This may surprise you, for I am only a humble Evangelist. But when I speak to men about the sacred meaning of life, I feel that you hold the same Truth which my words struggle in vain to disclose. We are traveling different roads, <span class="kay-gonda">Miss Gonda</span>, but we are bound to the same destination.
                    </p>

                    <span class="dialogue">HIX</span>: But you are safe—if this is the safety you want. I have turned the place over to you. You may stay here as long as you like. The decision will be yours.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: You do not want me to hide here?

                    <span class="dialogue">HIX</span>: I do not want you to hide.

                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: Yes. A heavy burden. And I wonder how much longer I will be able to carry it.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">HIX</span>: You may hide from the men who threaten you. But of what importance is that?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: Then you do not want to save me?

                    <span class="dialogue">HIX</span>: Oh, yes. I want to save you. But not from the police.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: From whom?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">HIX</span>: From yourself. <i>[She looks at him for a long moment, a fixed, steady glance, and does not answer]</i> You have committed a mortal sin. You have killed a human being. <i>[Points to the room]</i> Can this place—or any place—give you protection from that?

                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: Why?
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">HIX</span>: Because the joys of this earth are paid for by damnation in the Kingdom of Heaven. But if we choose to suffer, we are rewarded with eternal happiness.

Accept, of your own will, the worst that can be done to you. The infamy, the degradation, the prison cell, the scaffold. Then your punishment will become your glory.

                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: How?

                    <br><br>
                    <span class="dialogue">HIX</span>: Ours is a dark, imperfect world.

                    <span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>: Why is it not perfect? Because it cannot be? Or because we do not want it to be?

                    <i>[She raises her head]</i> You don't know the hours I've spent watching you across the infinite distance of a screen. I would give my life to keep you here in safety. I would let myself be torn to shreds, rather than see you hurt. Yet I am asking you to open this door and walk out to martyrdom. That is my chance of sacrifice. I am giving up the greatest thing that ever came to me.

Your fame is great. The story of your conversion will be heard the world over. You will redeem the scrubby wretches who come to this temple and all the wretches in all the slums.

It is a dreadful place, run by the most contemptible woman I've ever known. I'll take you there. I'll let you offer that woman the greatest gift—the kind of sensation she's never dared to imagine for her audience. You will confess to her crowd.
