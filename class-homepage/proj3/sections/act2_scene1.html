                        Some may call this letter a sacrilege. But as I write it, I do not feel like a sinner. For when I look at you on the screen, it seems to me that we are working for the same cause, you and I. This may surprise you, for I am only a humble Evangelist. But when I speak to men about the sacred meaning of life, I feel that you hold the same Truth which my words struggle in vain to disclose. We are traveling different roads, <span class="kay-gonda">Miss Gonda</span>, but we are bound to the same destination.
                    </p>

                        Lights go out, screen disappears. When the curtain rises on the temple of <span class="small-caps">CLAUDE IGNATIUS HIX</span>, the stage is almost completely black. Nothing can be seen of the room save the dim outline of a door, downstage Right, open upon a dark street. A small cross of electric lights burns high on wall Center. It throws just enough light to show the face and shoulders of <span class="small-caps">CLAUDE IGNATIUS HIX</span> high above the ground (he is standing in the pulpit, but this cannot be distinguished in the darkness). He is tall, gaunt, clothed in black; his hair is receding off a high forehead. His hands rise eloquently as he speaks into the darkness.

                    <br><br>
                    HIX: [Startled and angry] <i>You?</i> What are <i>you</i> doing here?
                    <br><br>
                    ESSIE TWOMEY: I heard you way from the street—it’s a blessed voice you have, though you don’t control your belly tones properly—and I didn’t want to intrude. I just slipped in.
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: [Icily] And of what service may I be to <i>you</i>?
                    <br><br>
                    ESSIE TWOMEY: Go ahead with the rehearsal. It’s an inspiring sermon you have there, a peach of a sermon. Though a bit on the old-fashioned side. Not modern enough, Brother Hix. That’s not the way I do it.
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: I do not recall having solicited advice, Sister Twomey, and I should like to inquire for the reason of this sudden visitation.
                    <br><br>
                    ESSIE TWOMEY: Praise the Lord! I’m a harbinger of good news. Yes, indeed. I got a corker for you.
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: I shall point out that we have never had any matters of common interest.
                    <br><br>
                    ESSIE TWOMEY: Verily, Brother Hix. You smacked the nail right on the head. That’s why you’ll be overjoyed at the proposition. [Settling herself comfortably down on a bench] It’s like this, brother: there’s no room in this neighborhood for you and me both.
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: Sister Twomey, these are the first words of truth I have ever heard emerging from your mouth.

                    ESSIE TWOMEY: The poor dear souls in these parts are heavily laden, indeed. They cannot support two temples. Why, the mangy bums haven’t got enough to feed the fleas on a dog!
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: Dare I believe, sister, that your conscience has spoken at last, and you are prepared to leave this neighborhood?
                    <br><br>
                    ESSIE TWOMEY: Who? Me leave this neighborhood? [Solemnly] Why, Brother Hix, you have no idea of the blessed work my temple is doing. The lost souls milling at its portals—praise the Lord! . . . [Sharply] No, brother, keep your shirt on. I’m going to buy you out.

                    <br><br>
                    ESSIE TWOMEY: Not that I really have to. You’re no competition. But I thought I might as well clear it up once and for all. I want this territory.
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: [Beside himself] You had the infernal presumption to suppose that the Temple of Eternal Truth was for sale?

                    ESSIE TWOMEY: Now, now, Brother Hix, let’s be modern. That’s no way to talk business. Just look at the facts. You’re washed up here, brother.

                    HIX: I will have you understand . . .
                    <br><br>
                    ESSIE TWOMEY: What kind of a draw do you get? Thirty or fifty heads on a big night. Look at me. Two thousand souls every evening, seeking the glory of God! <i>Two thousand</i> noses, actual count! I’m putting on a Midnight Service tonight—“The Night Life of the Angels”—and I’m expecting three thousand.
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: [Drawing himself up] There come moments in a man’s life when he is sorely pressed to remember the lesson of charity to all. I have no wish to insult you. But I have always considered you a tool of the Devil. My temple has stood in this neighborhood for . . .
                    <br><br>
                    ESSIE TWOMEY: I know. For twenty years. But times change, brother. You haven’t got what it takes anymore. You’re still in the horse-and-buggy age—praise the Lord!
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: The faith of my fathers is good enough for me.
                    <br><br>
                    ESSIE TWOMEY: Maybe so, brother, maybe so. But not for the customers. Now, for instance, take the name of your place: Temple of Eternal Truth. Folks don’t go for that nowadays. What have I got? The Little Church of the Cheery Corner. That draws ’em, brother. Like flies.
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: I do not wish to discuss it.
                    <br><br>
                    ESSIE TWOMEY: Look at what you were just rehearsing here. That’ll put ’em to sleep. Verily. You can’t hand out that line anymore. Now take my last sermon —“The Service Station of the Spirit.” There’s a lesson for you, brother! I had a whole service station built—[Rises, walks to pulpit]—right there, behind my pulpit. Tall pumps, glass and gold, labeled <span class=”small-caps”>Purity, Prayer, Prayer with Faith Super-Mixture</span>. And young boys in white uniforms—good-lookers, every one of ’em!—with gold wings, and caps inscribed <span class="small-caps">Creed Oil, Inc</span>. Clever, eh?

[Greatly inspired] Then I preached to my flock that when you travel the hard road of life, you must be sure that your tank is filled with the best gas of Faith, that your tires are inflated with the air of Charity, that your radiator is cooled with the sweet water of Temperance, that your battery is charged with the power of Righteousness, and that you beware of treacherous Detours which lead to perdition!

                    HIX: You have committed a mortal sin. You have killed a human being. [Points to the room] Can this place—or any place—give you protection from that?
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: No.
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: You cannot escape from your crime. Then do not try to run from it. Give up. Surrender. Confess.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: [Slowly] If I confess, they will take my life.
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: If you don’t, you will lose your life—the eternal life of your soul.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: Is it a choice, then? Must it be one or the other?
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: It has always been a choice. For all of us.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: Why?
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: Because the joys of this earth are paid for by damnation in the Kingdom of Heaven. But if we choose to suffer, we are rewarded with eternal happiness.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: Then we are on earth only in order to suffer?
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: And the greater the suffering, the greater our virtue. [Her head drops slowly] You have a sublime chance before you. Accept, of your own will, the worst that can be done to you. The infamy, the degradation, the prison cell, the scaffold. Then your punishment will become your glory.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: How?
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: It will let you enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: Why should I want to enter it?
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: If you know that a life of supreme beauty is possible—how can you help but want to enter it?
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: How can I help but want it here, on earth?
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: Ours is a dark, imperfect world.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: Why is it not perfect? Because it cannot be? Or because we do not want it to be?
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: This world is of no consequence. Whatever beauty it offers us is here only that we may sacrifice it—for the greater beauty beyond. 
                    <br><br>
                    [She is not looking at him. He stands watching her for a moment; then, his voice low with emotion:] You don’t know how lovely you are at this moment. [She raises her head] You don’t know the hours I’ve spent watching you across the infinite distance of a screen. I would give my life to keep you here in safety. I would let myself be torn to shreds, rather than see you hurt.
                    <br><br>
                    Yet I am asking you to open this door and walk out to martyrdom. That is my chance of sacrifice. I am giving up the greatest thing that ever came to me.

                    KAY GONDA: [Her voice soft and low] And after you and I have made our sacrifice, what will be left on this earth?
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: Our example. It will light the way for all the miserable souls who flounder in helpless depravity. They, too, will learn to renounce. Your fame is great. The story of your conversion will be heard the world over. You will redeem the scrubby wretches who come to this temple and all the wretches in all the slums.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: Such as that boy who was here?
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: Such as that boy. Let him be the symbol, not a nobler figure. That, too, is part of the sacrifice.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: [Slowly] What do you want me to do?
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: Confess your crime. Confess it publicly, to a crowd, to the hearing of all! 
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: Tonight?
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: Tonight!
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: But there is no crowd anywhere at this hour.
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: At this hour . . . [With sudden inspiration] Listen. At this hour, a large crowd is gathered in a temple of error, six blocks away. It is a dreadful place, run by the most contemptible woman I’ve ever known. I’ll take you there. I’ll let you offer that woman the greatest gift—the kind of sensation she’s never dared to imagine for her audience. You will confess to her crowd. Let her take the credit and the praise for your conversion. Let her take the fame. She is the one least worthy of it.
                    <br><br>
                    KAY GONDA: That, too, is part of the sacrifice?
                    <br><br>
                    HIX: Yes.
                    <br><br>
                    [KAY GONDA rises. She walks to the door, unlocks it, and flings it open. Then she turns to HIX and throws the key in his face. It strikes him as she goes out. He stands motionless, only his head dropping and his shoulders sagging]
