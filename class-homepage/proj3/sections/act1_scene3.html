                    <p>
                        I am an unknown artist. But I know to what heights I shall rise, for I carry a sacred banner which cannot fail—and which is you. I have painted nothing that was not you. You stand as a goddess on every canvas I've done. I have never seen you in person. I do not need to. I can draw your face with my eyes closed. For my spirit is but a mirror of yours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Someday you shall hear men speak of me. Until then, this is only a first tribute from your devoted priest—

                        Lights go out, screen disappears, and stage reveals studio of <span class="small-caps">DWIGHT LANGLEY</span>. It is a large room, flashy, dramatic, and disreputable. Center back, large window showing the dark sky and the shadows of treetops; entrance door center Left; door into next room upstage Right. A profusion of paintings and sketches on the walls, on the easels, on the floor; all are of <span class="small-caps kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>; heads, full figures, in modern clothes, in flowering drapes, naked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A mongrel assortment of strange types fills the room: men and women in all kinds of outfits, from tails and evening gowns to beach pajamas and slacks, none too prosperous-looking, all having one attribute in common—a glass in hand— and all showing signs of its effect.
                    </p>

                        <span class="small-caps">DWIGHT LANGLEY</span> lies stretched in the middle of a couch; he is young, with a tense, handsome, sunburned face, dark, disheveled hair, and a haughty, irresistible smile. <span class="small-caps">EUNICE HAMMOND</span> keeps apart from the guests, her eyes returning constantly, anxiously, to <span class="small-caps">LANGLEY</span>; she is a beautiful young girl, quiet, reticent, dressed in a smart, simple dark dress obviously more expensive than any garment in the room. As the curtain rises, the guests are lifting their glasses in a grand toast to <span class="small-caps">LANGLEY</span>, their voices piercing the raucous music coming over the radio.

                    WOMAN IN EVENING GOWN: Well, not that I mean to minimize Lanny’s triumph, but I must say that for the greatest exhibition of the decade, it was rather a fizz, wasn’t it? Two or three canvases with some idea of something, but the rest of the trash people have the nerve to exhibit these days . . .
