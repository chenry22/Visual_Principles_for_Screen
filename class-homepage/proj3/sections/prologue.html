            <h3>Office of Anthony Farrow in the Farrow Film Studios</h3>
        </div>

            <p><i>
                Late afternoon. Office of <span class="small-caps">ANTHONY FARROW</span> in the Farrow Film Studios. A spacious, luxurious room in an overdone modernistic style, which looks like the dream of a second-rate interior decorator with no limit set to the bill. 
            </i></p>
            <p><i>
                Entrance door is set diagonally in the upstage Right corner. Small private door downstage in wall Right. Window in wall Left. A poster of <span class="small-caps kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>, on wall Center; she stands erect, full figure, her arms at her sides, palms up, a strange woman, tall, very slender, very pale; her whole body is stretched up in such a line of reverent, desperate aspiration that the poster gives a strange air to the room, an air that does not belong in it. The words “<span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span> IN <span class="no-italic">FORBIDDEN ECSTASY</span>” stand out on the poster.
            </i></p>
            <p><i>
                The curtain rises to disclose <span class="small-caps">CLAIRE PEEMOLLER</span>, <span class="small-caps">SOL SALZER</span>, and <span class="small-caps">BILL McNITT</span>. <span class="small-caps">SALZER</span>, forty, short, stocky, stands with his back to the room, looking hopelessly out of the window, his fingers beating nervously, monotonously, against the glass pane. <span class="small-caps">CLAIRE PEEMOLLER</span>, in her early forties, tall, slender, with a sleek masculine haircut and an exotically tailored outfit, reclines in her chair, smoking a cigarette in a lengthy holder. <span class="small-caps">McNITT</span>, who looks like a brute of a man and acts it, lies rather than sits in a deep armchair, his legs stretched out, picking his teeth with a match. No one moves. No one speaks. No one looks at the others. The silence is tense, anxious, broken only by the sound of <span class="small-caps">SALZER</span>'s fingers on the glass.
            </i></p>

                    [<span class="small-caps">SALZER</span> turns slowly to look at him and turns away again, but stops the beating. Silence]

                <br>
                CLAIRE: <i>[Shrugging]</i> Well? <i>[No one answers]</i> Hasn't anyone here a suggestion to offer?
                <br><br>
                SALZER: <i>[Wearily]</i> Aw, shut up!
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: I see absolutely no sense in behaving like this. We can talk about something else, can't we?
                <br><br>
                McNITT: Well, talk about something else.
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: <i>[With unconvincing lightness]</i> I saw the rushes of <i>Love Nest</i> yesterday. It's a smash, but a smash! You should see Eric in that scene where he kills the old man and... <i>[A sudden jerk from the others. She stops short]</i> Oh, I see. I beg your pardon. <i>[Silence. She resumes uneasily]</i> Well, I'll tell you about my new car. The gorgeous thing is so chic! It's simply dripping, but dripping with chromium! I was doing eighty yesterday and not a bump! They say this new Sayers Gas is... <i>[There is a stunned, involuntary gasp from the others. She looks at two tense faces]</i> Well, what on earth is the matter?
                <br><br>
                SALZER: Listen, Peemoller, for God's sake, Peemoller, don't mention it!
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: What?
                <br><br>
                McNITT: The name!
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: What name?
                <br><br>
                SALZER: <i>Sayers</i>, for God's sake!
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: Oh! <i>[Shrugs with resignation]</i> I'm sorry.
                <br><br>

                    [Silence. <span class="small-caps">McNITT</span> breaks the match in his teeth, spits it out, produces a match folder, tears off another match, and continues with his dental work. A man's voice is heard in the next room. They all whirl toward the entrance door]
                </i></div>
                <br>
                SALZER: [Eagerly] There's Tony! He'll tell us! He must know something!

                <div class="block"><i>
                    [<span class="small-caps">ANTHONY FARROW</span> opens the door, but turns to speak to someone offstage before entering. He is tall, stately, middle-aged, handsomely tailored and offensively distinguished]
                </i></div>
                <br>
                FARROW: <i>[Speaking into the next room]</i> Try Santa Barbara again. Don't hang up until you get her personally. <i>[Enters, closing the door. The three look at him anxiously, expectantly]</i> My friends, has any of you seen <span class="kay-gonda">Kay Gonda</span> today? <i>[A great sigh, a moan of disappointment, rises from the others]</i>
                <br><br>
                SALZER: Well, that's that. You, too. And I thought you knew something! 
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Discipline, my friends. Let us keep our heads. The Farrow Studios expect each man to do his duty.
                <br><br>
                SALZER: Skip it, Tony! What's the latest? 
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: It's preposterous! <i>But</i> preposterous!
                <br><br>
                McNITT: I've always expected something like this from <span class="kay-gonda">Gonda</span>!
                <br><br>
                FARROW: No panic, please. There is no occasion for panic. I have called you here in order to formulate our policy in this emergency, coolly and calmly and... <i>[The interoffice communicator on his desk buzzes sharply. He leaps forward, his great calm forgotten, clicks the switch, speaks anxiously]</i> Yes?... You did? Santa Barbara?... Give it to me!... <i>What?!</i> Miss Sayers won't speak to <i>me</i>?!... She <i>can't</i> be out—it's an evasion! Did you tell them it was Anthony Farrow? Of the Farrow Films?... Are you sure you made it clear? President of the Farrow Films?... <i>[His voice falling dejectedly]</i> I see.... When did Miss Sayers leave?... It's an evasion. Try again in half an hour.... And try again to get the chief of police.
                <br><br>
                SALZER: <i>[Desperately]</i> That I could have told you! The Sayers dame won'''t talk. If the papers could get nothing out of her—we can't!
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Let us be systematic. We cannot face a crisis without a system. Let us have discipline, calm. Am I understood?... <i>[Breaks in two a pencil he has been playing with nervously] Calm!</i>
                <br><br>
                SALZER: Calm he wants at a time like this!
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Let us... <i>[The intercom buzzes. He leaps to it]</i> Yes?... Fine! Put him
                on!... <i>[Very jovially]</i> Hel-lo, Chief! How are you? I... <i>[Sharply]</i> What do you mean you have nothing to say? This is <i>Anthony Farrow</i> speaking!... Well, it usually <i>does</i> make a difference. Hell... I mean, Chief, there's only one question I have to ask you, and I think I'm entitled to an answer. Have there or have there not been any charges filed in Santa Barbara? <i>[Through his teeth]</i> Very well.... Thank you. <i>[Switches off, trying to control himself]</i>
                <br><br>
                SALZER: <i>[Anxiously]</i> Well?
                FARROW: <i>[Hopelessly]</i> He won't talk. No one will talk. <i>[Turns to the intercom
                again]</i> Miss Drake?... Have you tried <span class="kay-gonda">Miss Gonda's</span> home once more?... Have you tried all her friends?... I know she hasn't any, but try them anyway! [Is about to switch off, then adds] And get Mick Watts, if you can find the bast—if you can find him. If anyone knows, <i>he</i> knows!
                <br><br>
                McNITT: That one won't talk, either.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: And that is precisely the thing for us to do. Silence. Am I understood? <i>Silence</i>. Do not answer any questions on the lot or outside. Avoid all references to this morning's papers.
                <br><br>
                SALZER: <i>Us</i> the papers should avoid!
                <br><br>
                FARROW: They haven't said much so far. It's only rumors. Idle gossip.
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: But it's all over town! Hints, whispers, questions. If I could see any point in it, I'd say someone was spreading it intentionally.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Personally, I do not believe the story for a minute. However, I want all the information you can give me. I take it that none of you has seen <span class="kay-gonda">Miss Gonda</span> since yesterday?
                <br><br>
                <div class="block"><i>
                    [The others shrug hopelessly, shaking their heads]
                </i></div>
                <br>
                SALZER: If the papers couldn't find her—we can't.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Had she mentioned to any of you that she was going to have dinner with Granton Sayers last night?
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: When has she ever told anyone anything?
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Did you notice anything suspicious in her behavior when you saw her last?
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: I...
                <br><br>
                McNITT: I should say I did! I thought at the time it was damn funny. Yesterday morning, it was. I drove up to her beach home and there she was, out at sea, tearing through the rocks in a motorboat till I thought I'd have heart failure watching it.
                <br><br>
                SALZER: My God! That's against our contracts!
                <br><br>
                McNITT: What? My having heart failure?
                <br><br>
                SALZER: To hell with you! <span class="kay-gonda">Gonda</span> driving her motorboat!
                <br><br>
                McNITT: Try and stop her! So she climbs up to the road, finally, wet all over. “You'll get killed someday,” I say to her, and she looks straight at me and she says, “That won't make any difference to me,” she says, “nor to anyone else anywhere.”
                <br><br>
                FARROW: She said that?
                <br>
                McNITT: She did. “Listen,” I said, “I don't give a damn if you break your neck, but you'll get pneumonia in the middle of my next picture!” She looks at me in that damnable way of hers and she says, “Maybe there won't be any next picture.” And she walks straight back to the house and her damn flunky wouldn't let me in!
                <br><br>
                FARROW: She actually said that? Yesterday?
                <br><br>
                McNITT: She did—damn the slut! I never wanted to direct her, anyway. I...
                <br><br>
                <div class="block"><i>
                    [Intercom buzzes]
                </i></div>
                <br>
                FARROW: <i>[Clicking the switch]</i> Yes?... <i>Who?</i> Who is Goldstein and Goldstein? . . . <i>[Exploding]</i> Tell them to go to hell!... Wait! Tell them <span class="kay-gonda">Miss Gonda</span> does <i>not</i> need any attorneys! Tell them you don't know what on earth made them think she did! <i>[Switches off furiously]</i>
                <br><br>
                SALZER: God! I wish we'd never signed her! A headache we should have ever since she came on the lot!
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Sol! You're forgetting yourself! After all! Our greatest star! 
                <br><br>
                SALZER: Where did we find her? In the gutter we found her! In the gutter in Vienna! What do we get for our pains? Gratitude we get?
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: Down-to-earthiness, that's what she lacks. You know. No finer feelings. <i>But</i> none! No sense of human brotherhood. Honestly, I don't understand what they all see in her, anyway!
                <br><br>
                SALZER: Five million bucks net per each picture—that's what <i>I</i> see!
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: I don't know why she draws them like that. She's completely heartless. I
                went down to her house yesterday afternoon—to discuss her next script. And what's the use? She wouldn't let me put in a baby or a dog, as I wanted to. Dogs have such human appeal. You know, we're all brothers under the skin, and...
                <br><br>
                SALZER: Peemoller's right. She's got something there.
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: And furthermore... <i>[Stops suddenly]</i> Wait! That's funny! I haven't thought of this before. She did mention the dinner.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: <i>[Eagerly]</i> What did she say?
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: She got up and left me flat, saying she had to dress. “I'm going to Santa Barbara tonight,” she said. Then she added, “I do not like missions of charity.” 
                <br><br>
                SALZER: My God, what did she mean by that?
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: What does she mean by anything? So then I just couldn't resist it, <i>but</i> couldn't! I said, “<span class="kay-gonda">Miss Gonda</span>, do you really think you're so much better than everybody else?” And what did she have the nerve to answer? “Yes,” she said, “I do. I wish I didn't have to.”
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Why didn't you tell me this sooner?
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: I had forgotten. I really didn't know there was anything between <span class="kay-gonda">Gonda</span> and Granton Sayers.
                <br><br>
                McNITT: An old story. I thought she was through with him long ago.
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: What did <i>he</i> want with her?
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Well, Granton Sayers—you know Granton Sayers. A reckless fool.
                Fifty million dollars, three years ago. Today—who knows? Perhaps, fifty thousand. Perhaps, fifty cents. But cut-crystal swimming pools and Greek temples in his garden, and...
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: And <span class="kay-gonda">Kay Gonda</span>.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Ah, yes, and <span class="kay-gonda">Kay Gonda</span>. An expensive little plaything or artwork, depending on how you want to look at it. <span class="kay-gonda">Kay Gonda</span>, that is, two years ago. Not today. I know that she had not seen Sayers for over a year, previous to that dinner in Santa Barbara last night.
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: Had there been any quarrel between them?
                <br><br>
                FARROW: None. Never. That fool had proposed to her three times, to my knowledge. She could have had him, Greek temples and oil wells and all, anytime she winked an eyelash.
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: Has she had any trouble of any kind lately?
                <br><br>
                FARROW: None. None whatever. In fact, you know, she was to sign her new contract with us today. She promised me faithfully to be here at five, and...
                <br><br>
                SALZER: <i>[Clutching his head suddenly]</i> Tony! It's the contract!
                <br><br>
                FARROW: What about the contract?
                <br><br>
                SALZER: Maybe she's changed her mind again, and quit for good.
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: A pose, Mr. Salzer, just a pose. She's said that after every picture. 
                <br><br>
                SALZER: Yeah? You should laugh if you had to crawl after her on your knees like we've done for two months. “I'm through,” she says. “Does it really mean anything?” Five million net per each picture—does it mean anything! “Is it really worth doing?” Ha! Twenty thousand a week we offer her and she asks is it worth doing!
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Now, now, Sol. Control your subconscious. You know, I have an idea that she will come here at five. It would be just like her. She is so utterly unpredictable. We cannot judge her actions by the usual standards. With her— anything is possible.
                <br><br>
                SALZER: Say, Tony, how about the contract? Did she insist again... is there anything in it again about Mick Watts?
                <br><br>
                FARROW: <i>[Sighing]</i> There is, unfortunately. We had to write it in again. So long as she is with us, Mick Watts will be her personal press agent. Most unfortunate.
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: That's the kind of trash she gathers around her. But the rest of us aren't good enough for her! Well, if she's got herself into a mess now—I'm glad. Yes, glad! I don't see why we should all worry ourselves sick over it.
                <br><br>
                McNITT: I don't give a damn myself! I'd much rather direct Joan Tudor anyway. 
                <br><br>
                CLAIRE: And I'd just as soon write for Sally Sweeney. She's such a sweet kid. And...

                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: <i>[Brushing her aside]</i> Abominable discipline in your studio, Farrow! That's no way to run the place. <i>[<span class="small-caps">MISS DRAKE</span> slips out, closing the door]</i> Five reporters pounced on me at the gate and trailed me to your office. I suppose it will all appear in the evening papers, the color of my underwear included.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: My dear Miss Sayers! How do you do? So kind of you to come here! Rest assured that I...
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: Where's <span class="kay-gonda">Kay Gonda</span>? I must see her. At once.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: <i>[Looks at her, startled. Then:]</i> Do sit down, Miss Sayers. Please allow me to express my deepest sympathy for your grief at the untimely loss of your brother, who...
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: My brother was a fool. <i>[Sits down]</i> I've always known he'd end up like this.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: <i>[Cautiously]</i> I must admit I have not been able to learn all the unfortunate details. How <i>did</i> Mr. Sayers meet his death?
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: <i>[Glancing at him sharply]</i> Mr. Farrow, your time is valuable. So is mine. I did not come here to answer questions. In fact, I did not come here to speak to you at all. I came to find Miss <span class="kay-gonda">Gonda</span>. It is most urgent.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Miss Sayers, let us get this clear. I have been trying to get in touch with you since early this morning. You must know who started these rumors. And you must realize how utterly preposterous it is. Miss <span class="kay-gonda">Gonda</span> happens to have dinner with your brother last night. He is found dead, this morning, with a bullet through him.... Most unfortunate and I do sympathize, believe me, but is this ground enough for a suspicion of murder against a lady of Miss <span class="kay-gonda">Gonda</span>'s standing? Merely the fact that she happened to be the last one seen with him?
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: And the fact that nobody has seen her since. 
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Did she... did she really do it?
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: I have nothing to say about that.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Was there anyone else at your house last night? 
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: I have nothing to say about that.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: But good God! <i>[Controlling himself]</i> Look here, Miss Sayers, I can well understand that you may not wish to give it out to the press, but you can tell me, in strict confidence, can't you? What were the exact circumstances of your brother's death?
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: I have given my statement to the police.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: The police refuse to disclose anything!
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: They must have their reasons.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Miss Sayers! Please try to understand the position I'm in! I'm entitled to know. What actually happened at that dinner?
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: I have never spied on Granton and his mistresses.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: But...
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: Have you asked Miss <span class="kay-gonda">Gonda</span>? What did she say?
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Look here, if you don't talk—I don't talk, either.
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: I have not asked you to talk. In fact, I haven't the slightest interest in anything you may say. I want to see Miss <span class="kay-gonda">Gonda</span>. It is to her own advantage. To yours also, I suppose.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: May I give her the message?
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: Your technique is childish, my good man.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: But in heaven's name, what is it all about? If you've accused her of murder, you have no right to come here demanding to see her! If she's hiding, wouldn't she be hiding from you above all people?
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: Most unfortunate, if she is. Highly ill advised. Highly.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Look here, I'll offer you a bargain. You tell me everything and I'll take you to Miss <span class="kay-gonda">Gonda</span>. Not otherwise.
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: <i>[Rising]</i> I have always been told that picture people had abominable manners. Most regrettable. Please tell Miss <span class="kay-gonda">Gonda</span> that I have tried. I shall not be responsible for the consequences now.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: <i>[Rushing after her]</i> Wait! Miss Sayers! Wait a moment! <i>[She turns to him]</i> I'm so sorry! Please forgive me! I'm... I'm quite upset, as you can well understand. I beg of you, Miss Sayers, consider what it means! The greatest star of the screen! The dream woman of the world! They worship her, millions of them. It's practically a cult.
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: I have never approved of motion pictures. Never saw one. The pastime of morons.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: You wouldn't say that if you read her fan mail. Do you think it comes from shopgirls and schoolkids, like the usual kind of trash? No. Not <span class="kay-gonda">Kay Gonda</span>'s mail. From college professors and authors and judges and ministers! Everybody! Dirt farmers and international names! It's extraordinary! I've never seen anything like it in my whole career.
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: Indeed?
                <br><br>
                FARROW: I don't know what she does to them all—but she does something. She's not a movie star to them—she's a goddess. <i>[Correcting himself hastily]</i> Oh, forgive me. I understand how you must feel about her. Of course, you and I know that Miss <span class="kay-gonda">Gonda</span> is not exactly above reproach. She is, in fact, a very objectionable person who...
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: I thought she was a rather charming young woman. A bit anemic. A vitamin deficiency in her diet, no doubt. <i>[Turning to him suddenly]</i> Was she happy?
                <br><br>
                FARROW: <i>[Looking at her]</i> Why do you ask that?
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: I don't think she was.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: That, Miss Sayers, is a question I've been asking myself for years. She's a strange woman.
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: She is.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: But surely you can't hate her so much as to want to ruin her! 
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: I do not hate her at all.
                <br><br>
                FARROW: Then for heaven's sake, help me to save her name! Tell me what happened. One way or the other, only let's stop these rumors! Let's stop these rumors!
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: This is getting tiresome, my good man. For the last time, will you let me see Miss <span class="kay-gonda">Gonda</span> or won't you?
                <br><br>
                FARROW: I'm so sorry, but it is impossible, and...
                <br><br>
                MISS SAYERS: Either you are a fool or you don't know where she is yourself. Regrettable, in either case. I wish you a good day.
