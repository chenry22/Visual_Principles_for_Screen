            <h3>Office of Anthony Farrow in the Farrow Film Studios</h3>
        </div>

        <p><i>
            Late afternoon. Office of <span class="small-caps">ANTHONY FARROW</span> in the Farrow Film Studios. A spacious, luxurious room in an overdone modernistic style, which looks like the dream of a second-rate interior decorator with no limit set to the bill. 
        </i></p>
        <p><i>
            Entrance door is set diagonally in the upstage Right corner. Small private door downstage in wall Right. Window in wall Left. A poster of <span class="small-caps kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span>, on wall Center; she stands erect, full figure, her arms at her sides, palms up, a strange woman, tall, very slender, very pale; her whole body is stretched up in such a line of reverent, desperate aspiration that the poster gives a strange air to the room, an air that does not belong in it. The words “<span class="kay-gonda">KAY GONDA</span> IN <span class="no-italic">FORBIDDEN ECSTASY</span>” stand out on the poster.
        </i></p>
        <p><i>
            The curtain rises to disclose <span class="small-caps">CLAIRE PEEMOLLER</span>, <span class="small-caps">SOL SALZER</span>, and <span class="small-caps">BILL McNITT</span>. <span class="small-caps">SALZER</span>, forty, short, stocky, stands with his back to the room, looking hopelessly out of the window, his fingers beating nervously, monotonously, against the glass pane. <span class="small-caps">CLAIRE PEEMOLLER</span>, in her early forties, tall, slender, with a sleek masculine haircut and an exotically tailored outfit, reclines in her chair, smoking a cigarette in a lengthy holder. <span class="small-caps">McNITT</span>, who looks like a brute of a man and acts it, lies rather than sits in a deep armchair, his legs stretched out, picking his teeth with a match. No one moves. No one speaks. No one looks at the others. The silence is tense, anxious, broken only by the sound of <span class="small-caps">SALZER</span>’s fingers on the glass.

        <div class="script">
            McNITT: <i>[Exploding suddenly]</i> Stop it, for Christ’s sake!

                [<span class="small-caps">SALZER</span> turns slowly to look at him and turns away again, but stops the beating. Silence]

            <br>
            CLAIRE: <i>[Shrugging]</i> Well? <i>[No one answers]</i> Hasn’t anyone here a suggestion to offer?
            <br><br>
            SALZER: <i>[Wearily]</i> Aw, shut up!
            <br><br>
            CLAIRE: I see absolutely no sense in behaving like this. We can talk about something else, can’t we?
            <br><br>
            McNITT: Well, talk about something else.
            <br><br>
            CLAIRE: <i>[With unconvincing lightness]</i> I saw the rushes of <i>Love Nest</i> yesterday. It’s a smash, but a smash! You should see Eric in that scene where he kills the old man and... <i>[A sudden jerk from the others. She stops short]</i> Oh, I see. I beg your pardon. <i>[Silence. She resumes uneasily]</i> Well, I’ll tell you about my new car. The gorgeous thing is so chic! It’s simply dripping, but dripping with chromium! I was doing eighty yesterday and not a bump! They say this new Sayers Gas is... <i>[There is a stunned, involuntary gasp from the others. She looks at two tense faces]</i> Well, what on earth is the matter?
            <br><br>
            SALZER: Listen, Peemoller, for God’s sake, Peemoller, don’t mention it!
            <br><br>
            CLAIRE: What?
            <br><br>
            McNITT: The name!
            <br><br>
            CLAIRE: What name?
            <br><br>
            SALZER: Sayers, for God’s sake!
            <br><br>
            CLAIRE: Oh! <i>[Shrugs with resignation]</i> I’m sorry.
            <br><br>
            <div class="block"><i>
                [Silence. <span class="small-caps">McNITT</span> breaks the match in his teeth, spits it out, produces a match folder, tears off another match, and continues with his dental work. A man’s voice is heard in the next room. They all whirl toward the entrance door]
            </i></div>
            <br>
            SALZER: [Eagerly] There’s Tony! He’ll tell us! He must know something!
            <br><br>
            <div class="block"><i>
                [<span class="small-caps">ANTHONY FARROW</span> opens the door, but turns to speak to someone offstage before entering. He is tall, stately, middle-aged, handsomely tailored and offensively distinguished]
            </i></div>
            <br>
            FARROW: <i>[Speaking into the next room]</i> Try Santa Barbara again. Don’t hang up until you get her personally. <i>[Enters, closing the door. The three look at him anxiously, expectantly]</i> My friends, has any of you seen <span class="kay-gonda">Kay Gonda</span> today? <i>[A great sigh, a moan of disappointment, rises from the others]</i>
            <br><br>
            SALZER: Well, that’s that. You, too. And I thought you knew something! 
            <br><br>
            FARROW: Discipline, my friends. Let us keep our heads. The Farrow Studios expect each man to do his duty.
            <br><br>
            SALZER: Skip it, Tony! What’s the latest? 
            <br><br>
            CLAIRE: It’s preposterous! But preposterous!
